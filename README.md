# 🃏 CardDeck — Animation & Gesture System

A swipeable flashcard quiz app built with **React Native (Expo)** and **TypeScript**, demonstrating the Animation & Gesture capability group.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Expo Go app on your physical device (iOS / Android)

### Install & Run

```bash
# 1. Clone / unzip the project
cd CardDeck

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the Expo dev server
npx expo start

# 4. Scan the QR code with Expo Go on your phone
#    OR press 'a' for Android emulator / 'i' for iOS simulator
```

**Important:** This project uses Expo SDK 54.0.33. Ensure your Expo Go app is updated to version 54.x to avoid compatibility issues. If you encounter errors, try clearing Expo Go's cache or reinstalling the app.

## 📱 Features & Screens

| Screen | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CardDeck** (🃏) | Swipeable flashcard stack — swipe right if you know it, left to skip |
| **Study Plan** (📋) | Reorderable to-do list with LayoutAnimation transitions |
| **Statistics** (📊) | Animated progress rings, staggered stat cards, category bars |

## 🎞️ Animation Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. `PanResponder` — Swipe & Drag (SwipeCard.tsx)
- Cards respond to touch gestures via `PanResponder`
- Velocity-based swipe detection with a 30% screen-width threshold
- Snap-back with `Animated.spring` when threshold not reached

### 2. `Interpolation` — Color, Rotation, Opacity (SwipeCard.tsx)
- Card **rotates** as it's dragged (`position.x → rotate`)
- **KNOW IT / SKIP labels fade in** based on drag direction (`position.x → opacity`)
- Done-screen **scale-in** via `doneAnim → scale` interpolation

### 3. `Animated.spring` — Flip Animation (SwipeCard.tsx)
- Tap a card to flip it (question → answer) using spring physics
- Front and back faces use `rotateY` interpolation with `backfaceVisibility: 'hidden'`

### 4. `LayoutAnimation` — List Reordering (DraggableList.tsx)
- Pressing ▲▼ arrows triggers `LayoutAnimation.configureNext(easeInEaseOut)`
- Items slide smoothly into new positions without manual coordinate tracking
- Toggle completion also uses LayoutAnimation for smooth re-flow

### 5. `Animated.stagger` — Staggered Entrance (StatsScreen.tsx)
- Stat cards fly in with a 100ms stagger using `Animated.stagger`
- Category bars animate in sequentially with spring physics

### 6. Animated SVG `ProgressRing` (ProgressRing.tsx)
- Custom animated component using `react-native-svg`
- `strokeDashoffset` driven by `Animated.spring` for a smooth arc fill
- Used in both CardDeck screen and Stats screen

### 7. `Animated.sequence` — Pulse on Toggle (DraggableList.tsx)
- Checking off a list item triggers a quick scale pulse via `Animated.sequence`

```

### State Management
No external state library — React `useState` and `useRef` are sufficient for this scope. Each screen owns its data; a production app would lift state to Context or Zustand.

### Animation Philosophy
- `useNativeDriver: true` is used wherever possible (transforms, opacity) for 60fps on the JS thread
- `useNativeDriver: false` is used only where required (layout properties like `flex`, SVG `strokeDashoffset`)
- All `Animated.Value` refs are created with `useRef` to survive re-renders

## 📋 Deliverables Checklist

- [x] Expo project with TypeScript template (`tsconfig.json` with `strict: true`)
- [x] **5 animation capabilities** demonstrated (PanResponder, Interpolation, Spring, LayoutAnimation, Stagger)
- [x] TypeScript used throughout — no `any` types, proper interfaces for all props
- [x] App runs on physical device via Expo Go / emulator without crashes
- [x] `src/screens/` and `src/components/` structure
- [x] `types.ts` with all shared TypeScript definitions
- [x] README with setup, architecture, and team roles

## 🎤 Demo Flow (for presentation)

1. **CardDeck tab** — drag a card slowly to show rotation & label fade, then release (snap back). Swipe fully right. Flip a card by tapping it.
2. **Study Plan tab** — tap to complete items (pulse + LayoutAnimation). Use arrows to reorder (smooth slide).
3. **Stats tab** — navigate to show staggered card entrance and animating category bars.
4. Return to **CardDeck** — show the ProgressRing arc updating live.
